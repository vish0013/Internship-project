Build an Al-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application. 
>>>Business Overview Introduction to B2B Operations: The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit.
When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. 
This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. 
This is known in accounting terminology as “Accounts Receivable”. 

>>>“Accounts Receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products or services on credit. 
In most business entities, accounts receivable is typically executed by generating an invoice and either mailing or electronically delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within an established timeframe, called credit terms or payment terms." 

>>>Seller business interacts with various businesses and sells goods to all of them at various times. 
Hence, the seller business needs to keep track of the total amount it owes from all the buyers. 
This involves keeping track of all invoices from all the buyers.
Each invoice will have various important fields like a payment due date, invoice date, invoice amount, baseline date etc. 

The buyer business needs to clear its amount due before the due date. However, in real-world scenarios, the invoices are not always cleared ie. paid in full amount by the due date. The date on which a customer clears the payment for an invoice is called the payment date. 
Account receivables Department: 
1. In the ideal world, the buyer business should pay back within the 
stipulated time (ie the Payment Term). However, in the real world, the buyer business seldom pays within their established time frame, and this 
is where the Account Receivables Department comes into the picture. 2. Every business consists of a dedicated Account receivables Department to 
collect and track payment of invoices. 3. It consists of an Account receivables team that is responsible for: 
• Collecting payments from customers for their past due to invoices. 
• Sending reminders and follow-ups to the customers for payments to be 
made. 
• Looking after the entire process of getting the cash inflow. 
• Help the company get paid for the services and products supplied. 



>>>>Problem Statement for ML: 
As a winter internship project, you will be building a web application to help the people working in the Accounts Receivable departments in their day-to-day activities. You need to build a web application where the users in the Account Receivable department can : 
• View the invoice data from various buyers. 
• See various fields/attributes of the invoice(s) from a particular buyer. 
Perform Data Pre-processing on the invoice data. 
• Get account-level analytics to easily visualize and interpret data- EDA and 
Feature Engineering. 
• Get a prediction of when the invoice is going to get paid. 



>>>>>Problem Statement for Web Application Development: 
The objective of the Web Application Development internship project is: 
• To build a Full-stack Invoice Management Application using Reacts, 
JDBC, Java, Servlets. 
Build a responsive Receivables Dashboard. 
• Visualize Data in the form of grids.
