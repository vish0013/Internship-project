Build an Al-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application. 
Business Overview Introduction to B2B Operations: The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. This is known in accounting terminology as “Accounts Receivable”. 
“Accounts Receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products or services on credit. In most business entities, accounts receivable is typically executed by generating an invoice and either mailing or electronically delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within an established timeframe, called credit terms or payment terms." 
Seller business interacts with various businesses and sells goods to all of them at various times. Hence, the seller business needs to keep track of the total amount it owes from all the buyers. This involves keeping track of all invoices from all the buyers. Each invoice will have various important fields like a payment due date, invoice date, invoice amount, baseline date etc.
